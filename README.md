  - Change the text for each button (like PressJtoPlay but speecil)
 
### Results Screen Editor
  - Change the result text based on whether you passed or failed a level
  - Change the colour of the result tab based on whether you passed or failed a level
  
### Miscellaneous Tweaks
  - Change the main menu button's text colour
  - Disable the bomb explosion effect
